      Claude Usage Tracker has been updated to v#{version}!

      🆕 New in v1.13.0: Connect your Google account to Looker Studio
      for real cost data! On first launch, a prompt will guide you.
      Also includes significantly improved local cost accuracy.

      The app should open automatically. If it doesn't, launch it manually:
        open -a "Claude Usage Tracker"

      The app runs in your menu bar. Look for the 💰 icon.
